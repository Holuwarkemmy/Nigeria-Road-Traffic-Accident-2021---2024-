# Nigeria Road Traffic Accident Analysis (2021 - 2024)

## Overview

This project presents an interactive and professionally designed Microsoft Excel dashboard that analyzes road traffic accidents across Nigeria from Q1 2021 to Q3 2024. The dashboard offers rich visual insights into accident trends, severity, regional impact, and yearly casualties. It is aimed at supporting data-driven decision-making in road safety planning and intervention strategies.

Built with data visualization best practices, the dashboard uses a **red theme** to convey the urgency of road safety issues and uses slicers for interactivity.

## Project Aim

The aim of the project is to analyze, visualize, and derive actionable insights from Nigeria Road Traffic Accident data to inform safety interventions and policy decisions.

## Objectives

1. Identify high-risk zones and states with elevated accident and fatality rates.
2. Analyze accident trends over time to detect seasonal patterns.
3. Understand the severity levels of crashes to inform public awareness and emergency preparedness.

## Key Features

### KPIs Displayed
- **Total Accidents:** 44.3K  
- **Total Casualties:** 152.8K  
- **People Involved:** 292.9K  
- **Number Killed:** 21.6K  

### Visualizations Included
- **Line Chart:** Trend of accidents over time (by quarter)
- **Bar Chart:** Total accidents by geographic zone
- **Column Chart:** Yearly breakdown of casualties (injured vs killed)
- **Pie Chart:** Proportion of fatal, serious, and minor crashes
- **Filled Map:** State-wise distribution of accident counts
- **Slicers:** Interactive filters by quarter and geographical zone

## Insights

- **North Central and South West zones** reported the highest number of accidents.
- A noticeable decline in accidents began in 2023 after peaking in 2022.
- **Serious accidents** account for the majority (65%) of reported crashes.
- States like **Ogun, Lagos and Abuja** (FCT) are major accident hotspots.
- Some zones like **South East and South South** show unusually low figures, hinting at possible data underreporting.

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize high-risk zones** (e.g., North Central, South West) for safety infrastructure and education campaigns.
2. **Upgrade road and emergency systems** in areas with high fatality rates.
3. **Run awareness programs** targeted at zones with high crash severity.
4. **Track quarterly trends** to anticipate and mitigate seasonal spikes in accidents.
5. **Improve data collection and validation** in regions with suspiciously low accident reports.
