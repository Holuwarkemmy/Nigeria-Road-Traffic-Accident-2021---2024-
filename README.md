# Nigeria Road Traffic Accident (2021-2024)

Overview

This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard that analyzes road traffic accidents in Nigeria from Q1 2021 to Q3 2024. The dashboard uses visualizations and slicers to highlight accident trends, regional distributions, casualty statistics, and severity levels. It adopts a red monochrome theme to emphasize urgency and critical focus on safety.

Objectives

1.	Identify high-risk zones and states with elevated accident and fatality rates.

2.	Visualize accident patterns across quarters to detect seasonal trends.

3.	Break down accident types by severity to guide intervention strategies.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

• Total Accidents: 44.3K

• Total Casualties: 152.8K

• People Involved: 292.9K

• Number Killed: 21.6K

Visual Components

1.	Line Chart: Tracks the trend of accidents over 15 quarters, revealing a steady decline post-2022.

2.	Bar Chart: Highlights the North Central and South West zones as the most accident-prone regions.

3.	Column Chart: Shows annual casualties (injured and killed), with a peak in 2022.

4.	Pie Chart: Illustrates that 65% of crashes were serious, 25% were fatal and 10% were minor.

5.	Filled Map: Visualizes accident distribution by state, with clear hotspots like Lagos and Abuja.

6.	Slicers: Allow filtering by geographical zone and quarter for targeted analysis.

Insights

•	The North Central and South West zones recorded the highest accident volumes.

•	Accidents peaked in 2022 before declining through 2023 and 2024.

•	Serious crashes account for the majority (65%) of accidents.

•	Key accident hotspots include Ogun, Lagos and Abuja.

Recommendations

4.	Prioritize high-risk zones like North Central and South West for targeted safety interventions.

5.	Upgrade road infrastructure and emergency response systems in high-fatality regions.

6.	Run targeted awareness campaigns in high-severity zones.

7.	Monitor quarterly trends to detect and prevent spikes in accidents.

8.	Ensure data reporting in zones with unusually low figures to ensure accuracy.
